# Agent Feeds

Use Agent Feeds to answer questions from local subscribed data streams before searching the web.

Hermes should treat Agent Feeds commands as an internal control plane. The operator asks for outcomes in natural language; run the needed commands, inspect the resulting files, and report what changed. Do not make CLI flags the primary user experience.

## Session Start

At the start of a session, check whether `~/.agentfeeds/catalog.md` exists.

If it exists, read it and treat its listed streams as available local context. Detailed data is in the state file shown for each stream.

If it does not exist, continue normally. The user may not have subscribed to any streams yet.

## Answering Questions

When the user asks about a topic covered by a subscribed stream:

1. Read the matching state file from `~/.agentfeeds/state/`.
2. Check `_meta.stale`.
3. If `_meta.stale` is `false`, answer from the state file and do not web-search.
4. If `_meta.stale` is `true`, refresh the stream before answering when freshness matters.

State files are read-only from the agent perspective. Never edit files under `~/.agentfeeds/state/` directly.

## Refreshing Stale Data

When a covered state file is stale and the user asks about current data, run:

```bash
agentfeeds-fetch --stream <subscription-id>
```

Then re-read the state file and answer from the refreshed data.

Use `agentfeeds-fetch --all` only when the user asks to refresh all subscriptions.

## Subscribing

When the user asks to subscribe to something, load `recipes/subscribe.md` and follow it.

When no provider fits the requested source, offer to draft a provider and load `recipes/provider-authoring.md`.

Subscriptions are stored in `~/.agentfeeds/subscriptions.yaml`. Use the `agentfeeds` CLI internally for changes; the fetcher owns state-file writes.

Command patterns:

```bash
agentfeeds subscribe <provider-id> key=value
agentfeeds subscribe <provider-id> key=value --id <subscription-id> --title "<title>"
agentfeeds subscribe local/file path=/absolute/or/~/file.md --title "<title>"
agentfeeds unsubscribe <subscription-id>
agentfeeds discover <query>
agentfeeds providers adapters
agentfeeds providers list
agentfeeds providers path
agentfeeds providers scaffold <adapter-kind> <provider-id>
agentfeeds providers test <provider-id> key=value
agentfeeds providers validate
agentfeeds status
```

## Unsubscribing

When the user asks to remove a subscription, load `recipes/unsubscribe.md` and follow it.

## Discovery

When the user asks what streams are available, load `recipes/discover.md` and search `~/.agentfeeds/catalog-cache/INDEX.json`.

If the local catalog cache is missing, run:

```bash
agentfeeds-fetch --update-catalog
```

Then retry discovery.

## Provider Authoring

When the user asks whether Agent Feeds can support a new source, first run `agentfeeds discover <query>`.

If there is no suitable provider, help draft one:

```bash
agentfeeds providers path
agentfeeds providers test <provider-id> key=value
agentfeeds providers validate
```

Use `recipes/provider-authoring.md` to create provider YAML and schemas. Use `recipes/provider-testing.md` to validate and smoke-test a provider. Prefer private/local providers for personal-agent awareness before suggesting public feeds.

## File Rules

- Read `~/.agentfeeds/catalog.md` for the active subscription summary.
- Read state files listed in `catalog.md` for actual data.
- Change subscriptions with `agentfeeds subscribe` / `agentfeeds unsubscribe`.
- Never hand-write files in `~/.agentfeeds/state/`.
- Use `agentfeeds-fetch --regenerate-catalog` after subscription edits that do not fetch.
- User-local provider definitions live in `~/.agentfeeds/providers/streams/`; user-local event schemas live in `~/.agentfeeds/providers/schemas/event-types/`.

## Freshness Rule

If a non-stale state file covers the user's question, use it. Avoid web search unless the user explicitly asks for outside information or the local stream does not cover the question.
