# Unsubscribe Recipe

Use this when the user asks to remove an Agent Feeds subscription.

1. Identify the concrete subscription id with `agentfeeds streams list --json` or `agentfeeds streams search <query> --json`.
2. Run `agentfeeds unsubscribe <subscription-id>`.
3. If the user names a template instead, show matching concrete subscriptions and ask which one to remove.
4. Confirm what was removed.
